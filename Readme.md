# Lab 7: Experiment with texture mapping

## Starting point

The main branch in this repository renders a rotating cube with each side colored a different color.

The "texture" branch renders the same cube with each side textured with a picture of a bunny.

## Modification

Modify the texture coordinates and parameters to produce the cube "hw.mov". You may have to experiment to get the correct configuration.
